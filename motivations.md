- I am making this career change, because I definitively know it is one that I will be passionite about, and happy doing. I had the brief pleasure of working on an agile scrum team at my former company, and got to dabble in back end Python development. When the team dissolved and I was unable to move to another development team, I immediately began my search for structured programs to learn how to code, so I can officially pursue a career as a developer.
- I have been studying and self-teaching ever since, but I am eager to have a structured experience, and robust community aspect to accelerate my career change. I am grateful that the Turing admissions team saw potential in me, and decided to accept me to the program. I'm already having a blast!
